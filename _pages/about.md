## Roadmap

In no particular order...

* Finish processing the scanned papers up to 1947.
* Improve the search function, either by replacing the Algolia back-end or creating something new.
* Figure out how to get the "morgue books" (aka archives) after 1947 scanned and online. This will likely involve paying the Oklahoma Historical Society to do the work OR building a newspaper-sized scanning rig, like [this one](https://www.instructables.com/Book-Scanner-Low-cost-easy-to-make-1000-pages-an-h/).
* Better OpenGraph support, including the teaser images.
* Investigate and deploy the site using something other than a Static Site Generator.
