## Technical Details

Most, if not all the tools used to create this site are open-source.

* This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
* The site design is based on [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes), by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/).
* Icons on this site are provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
* PDF operations were performed using [Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/).
* Optical Character Recognition was performed using [Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/).
* Image processing was performed using [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/).
* Source code is stored in public [Github repos](https://github.com/thehydroreview) and deployed to production using modern CI/CD methods.
* Development and editing was done primarily in [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).
* Search word dictionaries are based on [SCOWL](http://wordlist.aspell.net/) that are built into the aspell tool.
* Source code for the site and theme are managed on [Github](https://github.com/thehydroreview).
* The automated conversion process was mostly done using several custom-built Python scripts. These are not stored in a public repo.
* Hosting is provided by AWS using S3 and CloudFront.

## Credits

* Word lists for the given and surnames were based on work done by Rhett Butler and published on their site at [probablyhelpful.com/](https://probablyhelpful.com/). All data is derived from David L. Word, Charles D. Coleman, Robert Nunziata and Robert Kominski (2008). *Demographic Aspects of Surnames from Census 2000*. U.S. Census Bureau.
* Much of the work on this site was based on the discoveries of others. There are countless numbers of [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and [Jekyll Talk](https://talk.jekyllrb.com) articles that we read to get everything organized. It's impossible to thank everyone whose body of knowledge was used to build this site, but their contributions are appreciated.

## Legal Status

The Hydro Review had a number of owners through the years. Regardless of the owners, the publication itself was never copyrighted. There is arguably someone that might lay claim to this, but there is the concept of Fair Use that we're relying on. This site is not monetized and the content does not generate revenue. Quite the opposite, given the costs to host the materials.

The last local publisher of the newspaper is deceased. His family support our use of this material.
