        This is due to how this site was built. In order to find the pages with specific words on them, we must have all the words, as text, on the web page. Since most of the content exists as images and PDF files, we had to use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to convert the images to text. The presence of these words adds little value for reading, but they need to be there and visible for the search engine to find them. So, we did the best we could to hide them from sight.
