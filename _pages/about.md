## Technical Details

See the [Technical Details](/details/) page for how the data was prepared and the site was built.

## Roadmap

In no particular order...

* ~~Finish processing the scanned papers up to 1947.~~ Done as of 30 November 2025.
* Improve the search function, either by replacing the Algolia back-end or creating something new.
* Get the "morgue books" (aka archives) after 1947 scanned and online. This will likely involve paying the Oklahoma Historical Society to do the work OR building a newspaper-sized scanning rig, like [this one](https://www.instructables.com/Book-Scanner-Low-cost-easy-to-make-1000-pages-an-h/). If the project goes down this route, it will need to provide consistent visual markers for [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) or other computer vision tools to locate. 
* Better OpenGraph support, including the teaser images. This is partially complete--if you share a linked page on Facebook or other social sites, it *should* show a thumbnail of the page or a small image for the site.
* Investigate and deploy the site using something other than a Static Site Generator. There is an open source project called Open Newspaper Initiative on Github that has promise. While the contributions have slowed down, the contributors do respond on their Slack channel.
* Provide reports from Google Analytics.
