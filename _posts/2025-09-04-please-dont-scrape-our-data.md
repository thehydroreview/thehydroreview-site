Bandwidth costs can be expensive for a volunteer project.

<!--more-->

The newspaper content on this site was provided to the Hydro Historical Society by the Oklahoma Historical Society. The content is primarily images and PDF files built from the images.

This is a non-profit organization and the hosting costs are paid by the volunteers that run the site. Bandwidth costs can be expensive if bots are pulling down our images multiple times. We have a `robots.txt` file on the site and we expect operators of those bots to comply with our requests. But, bots have no ethical requirements to comply, so if costs get too much, we'll pull the plug on the site.

If you want the data, we are happy to provide an entire archive of the images using a link to a publicly available download site. Send an email to `thehydroreview at gmail dot com` with your request.
