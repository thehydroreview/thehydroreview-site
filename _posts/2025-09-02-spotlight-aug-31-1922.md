The next column has a story about some local men caught playing poker. The paper wouldn't mention names, but "*everyone knows who they are*".

It would seem the Klan had already been operating in town, albeit a bit quietly. The previous September 8th, a small item at the bottom of page 6 declares

> It is possible that the Ku Klux Klan would not have made its reappearance had not the need of it appeared. If there were justice and fairness in all courts, and if laws were strictly enforced by all officials, such a contingency would never have arisen. Perhaps if the cause of the revival of this organization were removed it would see fit to disband of itself.

Ten years later, being known or suspected of being a member of the Klan was sufficient to derail a career, and rightly so. From reading the editors' comments each week, it seems likely they were a party to, or at least knew who these people were.
