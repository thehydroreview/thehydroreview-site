You've landed on this site. How can you find what you're looking for?

Search will be an ongoing technical problem to solve. There are some limitations to using search because of the 'static' nature of this site and its contents. Unlike interactive sites you find elsewhere on the web, there is no 'database' or 'back-end' software running this site. This allows us to host the site as cheaply and securely as possible without worrying if people are hacking our site.

We know search will be an important helper for you. You want to find out how your grandparents fared in this new state. Fortunately, there are solutions to this problem that just require time and effort. Search will improve as we have more time to do research and implement the pieces needed to make search a first-class experience. We'll also work to get the site indexed by Google, which will make finding content much easier for people searching the web for information about their ancestors. We'll get there.

For now, you're limited to single word searches on the site using the search button in the top of each page. That will give you links to specific issues. It's not a full word search. For now, it's limited to given names, surnames, and place names within Oklahoma and specifically this area. Once you've found an issue with the search term you want, open the "full issue" link with the masthead image of the Hydro Review, like the image below. This will open an Adobe PDF file in a new browser tab.

Within the PDF, you can do a more detailed search by pressing **CTRL-F**. It's best to zoom in to at least 75% to be able to see the highlighted search term.

If you're curious about the words that you can search on, each issue has a section called *Search Text* at the bottom. If you click the link labeled *All words*, you'll see an alphabetical list of the words that can be searched to find that page.

Happy searching. We hope you enjoy reading about Hydro through the years. If you have suggestions, please reach out to us using the contact page or on FaceBook.
