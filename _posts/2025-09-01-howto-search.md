You've landed on this site. How can you find what you're looking for?

<!--more-->

Search will be an ongoing technical problem to solve. There are limitations to using search because of the 'static' nature of this site and its contents. Unlike interactive sites elsewhere on the web, there is no 'database' or 'back-end' software running this site. This allows us to host the site as cheaply and securely as possible without worrying if people are hacking our site.

We know search will be an important feature for users. People want to find out how their grandparents fared in this new state. Fortunately, there are solutions to this problem that require time and effort. Search will improve as we have time to do research and implement the pieces needed. We'll also work to get the site indexed by Google, which will make finding content much easier. We'll get there.

For now, search is limited to single words or short phrases using the search button at the top of each page. The "full issue" link, as shown below, will open an Adobe PDF file in a new browser tab.

Within the PDF, search for a specific term by pressing **CTRL-F**. This will give better results than the site search. It's best to zoom in to at least 75% to be able to see the highlighted search term. Each issue's page has a section called *Search Text* at the bottom that has a list of the words that can be searched to find that page.
